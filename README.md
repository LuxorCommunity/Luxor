## Utilities & Benefits

- **Staking Utility (Live)**
  - Users can swap **SOL → LXR** via our official panel.
  - As long as LXR is held, our staking system accumulates rewards in the background.

- **Epoch-Based Rewards**
  - Rewards are collected over **8 Solana epochs**.
  - After the cycle completes, rewards can be claimed.

- **Rewards Are NOT Auto-Restaked**
  - This is intentional: you keep full flexibility.
  - Rewards can be swapped to SOL or other tokens — or used to increase your position for future cycles.

- **Community Support & Incentives**
  - We run initiatives to reward active community members and support organic growth.

- **DAO / Governance (In Development)**
  - We are working on a governance setup where **holders and especially stakers** will play a central role in shaping decisions.
  - Final implementation details may change during development.

## How Staking Works (Simple Overview)

1. You swap **SOL → LXR** on the official panel: https://lxrpanel.lxr-network.com/
2. While LXR is held, staking rewards accumulate in the background
3. Each staking cycle runs for **8 epochs**
4. When the cycle ends, rewards become claimable
5. Rewards can be used freely (swap, hold, or reinvest)
